## Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Modern web browser with WebGL support
- Camera access (for live detection)
- Minimum 4GB RAM recommended

### Installation
```bash
git clone https://github.com/rikulauttia/tactical-edge-ai.git
cd tactical-edge-ai
python3 -m http.server 8080
```

Open http://localhost:8080 in your browser.

### Usage
1. Wait for model initialization (approximately 10-15 seconds)
2. Click "START WEBCAM" to access camera or upload video file
3. Click "START DETECTION" to begin real-time analysis
4. Monitor threat levels and performance metrics
5. Export data using "EXPORT DATA" for analysis

## System Architecture

The system processes video input through a real-time detection pipeline:

1. **Input Layer**: Webcam feed or uploaded video files
2. **AI Processing**: TensorFlow.js with COCO-SSD model
3. **Threat Assessment**: Dynamic risk scoring based on detected objects
4. **Visualization**: Real-time bounding boxes and confidence scores
5. **Monitoring**: Performance metrics and system health tracking
6. **Export**: JSON data export for post-mission analysis

## Threat Assessment Matrix

Objects are classified into threat levels:
- **Level 0**: No threat (traffic lights, furniture)
- **Level 1**: Low threat (vehicles, personal items)
- **Level 2**: Medium threat (personnel, large vehicles, luggage)
- **Level 3**: High threat (aircraft, weapons, unknown objects)

## Use Cases

### Military Applications
- Perimeter security monitoring
- Vehicle checkpoint screening
- Personnel tracking in restricted areas
- Drone surveillance analysis

### Commercial Security
- Airport security screening
- Border control operations
- Critical infrastructure protection
